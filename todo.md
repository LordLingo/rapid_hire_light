# Follow-up scope

## 1. Backend + persistence
- [x] (Pivoted from DB) Add real POST /api/contact route persisting to data/contact_submissions.json (Vite middleware + Express in prod)
- [x] Validation on payload (required fields, email shape, length caps)
- [x] Wire Contact.tsx submit handler to fetch /api/contact (loading + error UI)
- [x] Smoke-tested via curl + browser console; submission file persists correctly
- [x] (Out of scope this round) Migrate persistence to a real DB table — intentionally deferred; current JSON-file persistence is the chosen interim solution and works in both dev and prod

## 2. About page
- [x] Create /pages/About.tsx (story, stats, principles, leadership, CTA)
- [x] Route /about in App.tsx
- [x] Footer Company → About wired

## 3. Pricing page
- [x] Create /pages/Pricing.tsx (Starter / Volume tiers + add-ons + pricing FAQ)
- [x] Route /pricing in App.tsx
- [x] Header NAV: Pricing → /pricing (real route, not placeholder)
- [x] Footer Company → Pricing wired
- [x] Cross-link "Get a quote / Talk to sales / Request a quote" CTAs to /contact

## 4. QA + ship
- [x] Visit each new route in preview (/, /services, /integrations, /pricing, /about, /contact)
- [x] Submit a test contact submission and verify the JSON store grew
- [x] Save checkpoint

## 5. Polish — page transitions + reveals
- [x] Add a route-aware PageTransition wrapper (CSS keyframe crossfade + soft lift, keyed by location)
- [x] Respect prefers-reduced-motion (transition + reveal disabled when user prefers reduced motion)
- [x] Upgrade reveal-on-scroll: IntersectionObserver one-shot, blur-fade-up, sibling-index stagger
- [x] Verify across /, /about, /pricing, /contact (HMR build clean, probe confirms 27 reveal targets + staggered delays applied)
- [x] Save checkpoint and deliver

## 6. Interactive pricing calculator
- [x] Build PricingCalculator component (1–1,000 hires/mo slider, Basic/Standard/Comprehensive packages, 10 add-on chips with per-check cost, live per-check / monthly / annual totals, automatic Starter↔Volume tier badge, tiered volume discount at 50/100/200/500)
- [x] Mount into Pricing page between tiers and add-ons (section 06 — Estimate)
- [x] Wire "Get this quote in writing" CTA to pre-fill /contact via volume + services + note query params
- [x] Update Contact page to read query params, map monthly hires → annual hiring-volume bucket, map calculator addon ids → Service chips, prefill message textarea with the estimate summary, and surface a “from your estimate” eyebrow
- [x] QA: at 250 hires/mo, per-check $60 → $50.40 (−16%), $12,600/mo, $151,200/yr, tier flips to Volume
- [x] Save checkpoint + deliver
